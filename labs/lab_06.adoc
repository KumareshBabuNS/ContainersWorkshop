= Lab 6 - Working with Docker Volumes

In this lab we'll experiment with Docker Volumes.
Volumes are directories within one or more containers that bypass the Union File System.
They are designed for the persistence of data independent of the lifecycle of any one container.

== Create a New Volume with a Container

. Create a new Debian container with a volume called `/data`:
+
----
$ docker run --name my_volume -it -v /data debian
----
+
NOTE: On Windows, if you run into complaints from Docker about ``invalid characters for a local volume name,'' try substituting `//data` for `/data`.
+
This will open an interactive Bash shell inside the new container.

. In a separate terminal window, inspect the container to view its volume information:
+
----
$ docker inspect -f '{{json .Mounts}}' my_volume [{"Name":"9949767fbc42b370aa925661be1efc06785354bdb73d7352c5006b3d303fab5f","Source":"/mnt/sda1/var/lib/docker/volumes/9949767fbc42b370aa925661be1efc06785354bdb73d7352c5006b3d303fab5f/_data","Destination":"/data","Driver":"local","Mode":"","RW":true}]
----
+
This command gives you various details about the volume you created, including its location inside of your Boot2Docker VM and that its read/write bit is set to true.

. In the container terminal window, add some data to `/data`:
+
----
$ echo bar > /data/foo && cat /data/foo
bar
----

. Kill the container by exiting from the container terminal window:
+
----
$ exit
exit
----

== Mount Another Container's Volume in a New Container

. Create a new container which mounts the volume from `my_volume` using the `--volumes-from` flag:
+
----
$ docker run --name mount_existing_volume -it --volumes-from my_volume debian
----

. Verify that the data you created earlier is still available:
+
----
$ cat /data/foo
bar
----

. Kill the container by exiting from the container terminal window:
+
----
$ exit
exit
----

== Mount a Host Directory in a New Container

Docker also supports mounting existing host directories as volumes. Boot2docker attempts to share the home directory tree (e.g. `/Users` on OS X) into the VM, so you ought to be able to share directories within that tree. We'll try that here.

. Within your ``home'' directory, create a new directory called 'docker_data', and change to the directory:
+
----
$ mkdir docker_data && cd docker_data
----

. Add some data to the current directory:
+
----
$ echo bar >> foo
----

. Create a new container which mounts the current working directory as `/data`:
+
----
$ docker run --name mount_host_dir -it -v $(pwd):/data debian
----
+
NOTE: Windows Users: The `$(pwd)` syntax will probably not work for you. Instead, run `pwd` separately at the prompt. Take the value and ``double up'' all of the slashes. Here's an example: `docker run --name mount_host_dir -it -v //c//Users//vagrant//docker_data://data debian`

. Verify that the data you created earlier is still available:
+
----
$ cat /data/foo
bar
----

. Kill the container by exiting from the container terminal window:
+
----
$ exit
exit
----

== Persist Data Between MySQL Containers Using a Data Volume Container

Containers can be created solely for the purpose of creating volumes that will be mounted into other containers. These containers are called _Data Volume Containers_. We'll use a data volume container to persist data from a MySQL database across multiple MySQL containers.

. Create a Debian container to serve as the MySQL data volume container:
+
----
$ docker create --name my-mysql-volumes -v /var/lib/mysql debian /bin/true
----
+
The MySQL container image we'll be using expects to persist its data at `/var/lib/mysql`. When we mount the volume we just created, its contents will take the place of `/var/lib/mysql` within the container's union file system.

. Create a MySQL container which will host the MySQL processes:
+
----
$ docker run --name my-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d --volumes-from my-mysql-volumes mysql
----

. Change your directory to the location of the MySQL init script we'll use:
+
----
$ cd $WORKSHOP_HOME/ContainersWorkshop/code/mysql-scripts
----

. Execute the script using the MySQL client in an ephemeral container:
+
----
$ docker run -it --link my-mysql:mysql -v $(pwd):/scripts --rm mysql sh -c 'exec mysql -h"$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR" -P"$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT" -uroot -p"$MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" < /scripts/foo.sql'
----
+
NOTE: Windows Users: Continue to apply the ``double slash'' technique as required.
+
This command mounts the current directory as `/scripts` and then executes the `mysql` client command, passing it connection information obtained from Docker link environment variables, as well as the `foo.sql` script.

. Interactively verify that the data was loaded:
+
----
$ docker run -it --link my-mysql:mysql --rm mysql sh -c 'exec mysql -h"$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR" -P"$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT" -uroot -p"$MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"'

. Kill and remove the `my-mysql` container:

$ docker kill my-mysql && docker rm my-mysql
my-mysql
